# Number-File-Generator-3000
This program creates a file called "numbers.txt" with a list of random numbers. The user is able to choose the list size and quantity of prime numbers.

The purpose of this program is to help students test their programming homework which reads a file of random numbers and displays the quantity of numbers and quantity of primes.
Otherwise, students would have had to create their own file to test which could've been laborsome.
